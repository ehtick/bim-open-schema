# BIM Open Schema 

**BIM Open Schema** is an open formal specification of BIM data, including 3D geometry, that is optimized and designed for large-scale 
data and modern tools and pipelines that uses [**Parquet**](https://parquet.apache.org/) to store data in a compact and widely supported 
binary format.

👉 [***Get the Revit 2025 exporter here!***](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-schema/releases)

The official release comes with an exporter for Revit 2025 and Ara 3D Studio for viewing and exploring the contents of BIM Open Schema files.  

## Repository Contents

This repository provides:

1. [Official specification](src/Ara3D.BimOpenSchema) - the C# types that define the tables, columns, enums, and manifest. The project has no dependencies. See [source-code.md](source-code.md).
2. [Sample test files](examples) - generated from the Autodesk sample files.
3. [BIM Open Schema Exporter](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-schema/releases) - an exporter for Revit 2025 bundled with Ara 3D Studio.

The C# reference implementation (reading, writing, querying, converting from IFC and Revit) lives in
[BIM Open Toolkit](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-toolkit).

## Additional BIM Open Schema Tools and Resources

BIM Open Schema comes with an ecosystem of open-source tools in other repositories for 

- [Reading and querying BIM Open Schema (.BOS) files](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-toolkit/tree/main/src/Ara3D.BimOpenSchema.IO) and [loading them into DuckDB](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-toolkit/tree/main/src/Ara3D.BimOpenSchema.DuckDb) with BIM Open Toolkit
- [Converting IFC files to BOS and analysing them](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-toolkit) with BIM Open Toolkit
- [Exporting BOS files from Revit](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-toolkit/tree/main/plugins/Ara3D.BIMOpenSchema.Revit2025)
- [Displaying BOS data in WPF Datagrid controls](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-toolkit/tree/main/apps/Ara3D.BimOpenSchema.Browser) along with exporting to GLTF and Excel files
- [Loading, Viewing, and Querying BOS files in the browser](https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d-webgl)
- [Querying BOS data in the browser via DuckDB](https://bim-open-schema-reader.vercel.app)

## About Parquet

[**Parquet**](https://parquet.apache.org/) is a very compact, efficient, and widely supported binary format for tabular data.  
It is self-describing and validating. Unlike with CSV or JSON, a Parquet importer can determine exactly how many rows and columns of data 
there are and what data types are contained within. 

## The .bos File Extension

BIM Open Schema files have the extension `.bos` and are zip archives containing several `.parquet` files. 
You can rename the extension to a `.zip` and open the archive with Windows explorer and other common tools.

## Example Use Cases for Parquet Data

1. analytics - [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [**Power BI**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi)
2. databases - [**DuckDB**](https://duckdb.org/), [**BIM Lakehouse**](https://bimlakehouse.com), [**BIM Open Schema Reader**](https://bim-open-schema-reader.vercel.app/)
3. serialization - [**Parquet**](https://parquet.apache.org/)
4. interactive visualization - [**Ara 3D Studio**](https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d-studio), [**Ara 3D WebGL**](https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d-webgl).

## What is a Schema? 

A schema describes the meaning, relationships, and structure of data. The **BIM Open Schema** project is agnostic of the specific serialization format
(e.g. you could use JSON or FlatBuffer), but it is optimized for structured self-describing columnar binary data formats, particularly **Parquet**.  

## Platform and Language Agnostic 

The schema is optimized for serialization to/from columnar and tabular data formats, such as those used by relational databases, 
but it is *not* tied to any one particular serialization format, and can be easily converted to many different 
formats for fast inspection in your tool of choice. 

This project comes with C# code which acts as the official specification, but the schema is platform independent 
and language agnostic. 

We welcome code contributions in any language. 

## Parquet Files contained in the BOS Archive

The contents of the .bos archive are the following parquet files: 

- **Non Geometry Data**
  - Entities.parquet
  - Descriptors.parquet
  - Documents.parquet
  - Points.parquet
  - Strings.parquet
  - Numbers.parquet
  - Parameters.parquet
- **Geometry Data** 
  - Elements.parquet
  - Transforms.parquet
  - VertexBuffer.parquet
  - IndexBuffer.parquet
  - Materials.parquet
  - Meshes.parquet

## Show me the Code

The specification itself is the C# project under [`src`](src). See [source-code.md](source-code.md)
for what each file defines, how to build it, and how to change a table.

The C# reference implementation, with its tests, lives in
[BIM Open Toolkit](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-toolkit).
